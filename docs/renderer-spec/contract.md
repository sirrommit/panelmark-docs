# Renderer Contract

This document defines the minimum required behavior for a compatible `panelmark` renderer.

It is about behavior and API boundary, not internal implementation strategy. A renderer that satisfies all requirements here is considered core-compatible regardless of how it is implemented internally.

## Core principle

`panelmark` core owns the shell model.

A renderer owns:

- presentation
- event collection and input mapping
- focus routing into assigned interactions
- execution of draw commands
- any renderer-specific hosting or widget behavior

## What `panelmark` core provides

The following modules form the panelmark core API surface that renderers depend on.

| Component | Module | Role |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Shell definition parser | `panelmark.parser` | Converts the shell string into a `LayoutModel` tree |
| Layout model | `panelmark.layout` | `HSplit`, `VSplit`, `Panel`, `Region`; resolves geometry |
| `Shell` state machine | `panelmark.shell` | Assigns interactions, manages focus, dispatches keys, tracks dirty regions |
| `Interaction` ABC | `panelmark.interactions` | Abstract base: `render`, `handle_key`, `get_value`, `set_value`, `is_focusable`, `signal_return` |
| Draw command types | `panelmark.draw` | `WriteCmd`, `FillCmd`, `CursorCmd`, `RenderContext`, `DrawCommand` |
| Style tag parser | `panelmark.style` | Parses `<bold>text</>` markup in border titles |
| Exceptions | `panelmark.exceptions` | `RegionNotFoundError`, `CircularUpdateError` |

**`panelmark` has zero runtime dependencies.** It does not import `blessed`, any GUI toolkit, or any web framework.

## Required capabilities

### 1. Shell hosting

A renderer must be able to host a `panelmark.Shell` instance and drive it to completion.

Minimum responsibilities:

- resolve layout geometry for the target viewport
- render shell chrome (borders, headings, dividers) based on resolved geometry
- render each assigned interaction into its resolved region
- drive the event loop until the shell exits
- observe and act on shell exit signals

A renderer must provide a concrete `Shell` subclass with a `run()` method that sets up the output surface, runs the event loop, and tears down the surface on exit.

### 2. Region rendering

A renderer must render interactions into their resolved named regions.

Minimum responsibilities:

- construct a `RenderContext` for each region, using the known viewport dimensions and capability flags
- call `interaction.render(context, focused)` to obtain draw commands
- execute the returned command list through a command executor
- handle redraw after dirty state changes

The `Interaction.render()` contract:

```python
def render(self, context: RenderContext, focused: bool = False) -> list[DrawCommand]:
    ...
```

- `context.width` / `context.height` — dimensions of the assigned region in character columns and rows
- `context.supports(feature)` — capability query (see [RenderContext](#rendercontext) below)
- **All coordinates in returned commands are region-relative.** `(0, 0)` is the top-left cell of the region. The executor maps region-relative coordinates to screen-absolute coordinates when executing commands.
- `render()` must have no side effects. It returns data; it does not write output.

Interactions may branch on renderer capabilities inside `render()` via `context.supports(feature)`. They do not have direct access to terminal objects or renderer internals.

### 3. Draw command execution

A renderer must correctly execute every draw command type defined in `panelmark.draw`.

The executor is responsible for clipping. Interactions should not emit commands that exceed `context.width` columns from the given column, but the executor must handle clipping defensively.

**Why draw commands, not direct output:** `render()` returns data rather than performing side effects. This keeps interactions as pure functions of state, making them easy to unit-test by asserting on the returned command list without capturing stdout or mocking a terminal.

#### `WriteCmd` — write styled text

```python
from panelmark.draw import WriteCmd

WriteCmd(
    row: int,                    # region-relative row (0-based)
    col: int,                    # region-relative column (0-based)
    text: str,                   # text to write; should not contain newlines
    style: dict | None = None,   # optional styling
)
```

Writes `text` at the given position. No automatic clipping — callers should ensure `text` fits within `context.width - col` characters.

#### `FillCmd` — fill a rectangle

```python
from panelmark.draw import FillCmd

FillCmd(
    row: int,           # top-left corner row
    col: int,           # top-left corner column
    width: int,         # number of columns to fill
    height: int,        # number of rows to fill
    char: str = ' ',    # fill character (default: space)
    style: dict | None = None,
)
```

Fills a rectangular area with repeated `char`. The default `char=' '` clears the area.

#### `CursorCmd` — position the text cursor

```python
from panelmark.draw import CursorCmd

CursorCmd(
    row: int,   # region-relative row
    col: int,   # region-relative column
)
```

A **hint**, not a draw operation. Renderers that support a visible cursor (checked via `context.supports('cursor')`) move the cursor here after executing all other commands. Renderers without cursor support ignore it entirely.

At most one `CursorCmd` should appear in a command list. If multiple are present, the executor uses the last one.

#### Type alias

```python
from panelmark.draw import DrawCommand
# DrawCommand = WriteCmd | FillCmd | CursorCmd
# render() returns list[DrawCommand]
```

#### Style dict

The optional `style` argument on `WriteCmd` and `FillCmd` is a plain Python `dict`. All keys are optional. Renderers apply the keys they support and silently ignore the rest — unknown keys are not an error.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `bold` | `bool` | Bold / heavy weight |
| `italic` | `bool` | Italic (renderers without italic support use normal) |
| `underline` | `bool` | Underline |
| `reverse` | `bool` | Swap foreground and background colours |
| `color` | `str` | Foreground colour name |
| `bg` | `str` | Background colour name |

**Colour names:** `'black'`, `'red'`, `'green'`, `'yellow'`, `'blue'`, `'magenta'`, `'cyan'`, `'white'`

#### RenderContext

`RenderContext` is passed to every `render()` call. It carries the region's dimensions and the set of capabilities the renderer supports.

```python
from panelmark.draw import RenderContext

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class RenderContext:
    width: int                           # region width in columns
    height: int                          # region height in rows
    capabilities: frozenset[str]         # renderer feature flags

    def supports(self, feature: str) -> bool: ...
```

Use `context.supports(feature)` to write portable interactions that degrade gracefully on limited renderers.

| Feature | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `'color'` | At least 8 foreground/background colours |
| `'256color'` | 256-colour palette |
| `'truecolor'` | 24-bit (16 million) colours |
| `'unicode'` | Unicode characters render correctly |
| `'cursor'` | A text cursor can be positioned |
| `'italic'` | Italic text is visually distinct from normal |

### 4. Input dispatch

A renderer must collect input events and route them through the shell.

Minimum responsibilities:

- collect input events from its surface
- convert them into the input form expected by `Shell.handle_key()`
- pass each event to `shell.handle_key(key)` and observe the return value

`Shell.handle_key(key)` returns either `('exit', value)` or `('continue', None)`.

#### Key string format

`Shell.handle_key` accepts a single `str` argument in one of three forms:

| Category | Form | Examples |
|----------|------|---------|
| Printable character | The character itself | `'a'`, `'Z'`, `' '`, `'\t'` |
| Named key | `KEY_` prefix | `'KEY_UP'`, `'KEY_DOWN'`, `'KEY_LEFT'`, `'KEY_RIGHT'`, `'KEY_ENTER'`, `'KEY_TAB'`, `'KEY_BTAB'`, `'KEY_BACKSPACE'`, `'KEY_DELETE'`, `'KEY_HOME'`, `'KEY_END'`, `'KEY_PGUP'`, `'KEY_PGDN'`, `'KEY_F1'`–`'KEY_F12'` |
| Control character | Literal escape value | `'\x11'` (Ctrl+Q), `'\x1b'` (Escape) |

These names are panelmark's canonical contract — they are not blessed-specific. Any renderer must map its native input events to these forms before calling `handle_key`.

By default, the base `Shell` treats `'\x1b'` (Escape) and `'\x11'` (Ctrl+Q) as exit signals. Renderers should pass them through unmodified so that the shell's exit semantics are preserved.

#### Return value

`Shell.handle_key(key)` returns a `tuple[str, Any]`:

- `('exit', value)` — the shell has finished; the renderer should stop its event loop and return `value` to its caller
- `('continue', None)` — the shell is still running; the renderer should keep looping

### 5. Focus handling

A renderer must honor shell focus behavior.

Minimum responsibilities:

- pass the correct `focused` boolean to `interaction.render(context, focused)` for each region
- route input to the focused interaction via shell dispatch
- support shell-level focus movement semantics

The spec does not constrain surface-specific focus affordances (cursor blinking, highlight colors, etc.). Those are renderer decisions.

### 6. Dirty / redraw behavior

A renderer must support redraw based on shell dirty state.

Minimum responsibilities:

- observe dirty regions after key handling or update operations
- redraw those regions
- call `shell.mark_all_clean()` after redraw

The spec does not constrain whether the renderer uses incremental redraw, full redraw, retained buffers, or other optimizations.

#### Dirty-region tracking

`shell.dirty_regions` is a `set[str]` of region names that need re-rendering. It is updated by:

- `shell.handle_key(key)` — any interaction or focus change that modifies state marks affected regions dirty
- `shell.update(name, value)` — marks the named region dirty
- focus transitions — both the previously focused region and the newly focused region are added to the dirty set

`shell.mark_all_clean()` clears the dirty set. Call it after the renderer has finished re-rendering all dirty regions.

Expected render loop:

```python
while True:
    key = collect_input()          # renderer-specific
    result, value = shell.handle_key(key)
    for name in shell.dirty_regions:
        region = shell.get_region(name)
        interaction = shell.get_interaction(name)
        ctx = RenderContext(width=region.width, height=region.height, ...)
        cmds = interaction.render(ctx, focused=(name == shell.focused))
        executor.execute(region, cmds)
    shell.mark_all_clean()
    if result == 'exit':
        break
```

### 7. Shell return semantics

A renderer must implement shell return behavior consistently.

Minimum responsibilities:

- when `shell.handle_key(key)` returns `('exit', value)`, stop the current shell host and return `value` to the caller
- honor interaction `signal_return()` behavior through the shell

### 8. Interaction semantics

The renderer must preserve the core interaction semantics.

- `get_value()` — returns current logical state
- `set_value(value)` — restores logical state
- `signal_return()` — explicit accept/submit behavior

The renderer is not responsible for inventing these semantics. It must not break them.

## Optional renderer capabilities

The following are allowed but not required for core compatibility.

- modal shell hosting
- embedded shell hosting (non-fullscreen)
- mouse support
- clipboard integration
- native dialogs
- animation support
- timers and async repaint helpers
- accessibility integrations

Optional capabilities must be documented as renderer-specific unless they are part of the portable standard library. See [Extensions](extensions.md).

## Compatibility levels

See [Extensions](extensions.md) for the full compatibility label definitions. In brief:

- `core-compatible` — implements this contract
- `portable-library-compatible` — also implements the portable widget layer
- `extended` — adds renderer-specific capabilities beyond the portable contract
